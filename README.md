laravel-forms
=============

Extends the Laravel FormBuilder object (Form:: facade) to automatically output form fields with Foundation- or Bootstrap-specific wrapping markup around them.

Installation
============

1. Require `"npmweb/laravel-forms": "~1.0"` in your `composer.json` file.
2. Run `composer install` or `composer update` to download it and have the autoloader updated.
3. Open `app/config/app.php` and make the following changes under the `providers` key:
	a. Comment out `'Illuminate\Html\HtmlServiceProvider'`
	b. Add `'NpmWeb\FormBuilder\HtmlServiceProvider'`

Configuration
=============

You will probably want to change the default configuration. First, publish the package config file:

    $ php artisan config:publish npmweb/laravel-forms
    
The following options are available:

- `'css_framework'`: Defaults to `'foundation'` (Foundation 5) but can also be set to `'bootstrap'` (Bootstrap 3). This changes what markup is generated to fit with the given CSS framework's default form layout.
- `'col_width'`: The grid class for the form field's container element. For example, in Foundation `'large-6'` will make the container take up 6 out of 12 columns.
- `'row_per_field'`: Defaults to `false`, in which case each form field is outputted directly, and you have to wrap it in a row yourself. If you set it to `true`, each form field container is wrapped in a row, forcing it to be one field per row.

Usage
=====

Just use any of Laravel's normal `Form::` methods, such as `Form::text()` or `Form::select()`. Instead of outputting the bare form control, it will also output the wrapping DOM elements appropriate to your selected CSS framework.

Additionally, a `Form::readonly()` method has been added. This outputs a read-only value wrapped in the same DOM elements, allowing you to include read-only "fields" in your forms.
